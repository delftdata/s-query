    #Â Hazelcast Jet has several techniques that simplify the formation of the
    # cluster by automatically discovering the other nodes. This config section
    # lists some. Jet will form a cluster only with nodes using the same discovery
    # mechanism, so make sure to enable only one.
#    join:
#      # The default way to discover nodes: using the IP multicast. This is the
#      # simplest technique, but in a cloud setting the network usually doesn't
#      # allow multicast.
